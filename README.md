Total Price Calculator!

Purpose: The purpose of this project was to create a code that would show the total amount of up to 5 items. The program gets the sum of all items, as well as the sales tax. 

How it Works: This program is simple. The program will proceed to ask the user the price in $, for each item purchased. After each item amount is input, the sum is provided. The sum is first provided without sales tax. The program then calculates the sales tax, at a rate of 0.07. Finally, it displays the Subtotal, Sales tax, and Total amount for all items together.
